## Three kinds of sources used for academic research
1. Primary Sources
2. Secondary Sources
3. Reference Sources


## Primary Sources
What is a primary source?

A _primary source_ is a document, image, artifact, or dataset that provides first-hand testimony or direct evidence concerning the object of research.

### Examples of primary sources
* Diaries
* Correspondence
* Government documents
* Newspapers
* Material objects
* Survey data

## Secondary Sources
What is a secondary source?

A _secondary source_ is a scholarly discussion based on primary sources. Typically, a secondary source contains original research.

## Examples of Secondary Sources
* Books
* Journal articles
* Scientific reports
* Lectures
* Podcasts

Can you think of other examples of secondary sources?


### Reference Sources
What is a reference source?

A _reference source_ is a book or article that summarizes and synthesizes secondary sources. Typically, a reference source does not contain original research.

### Examples of Reference Sources
* Encyclopedias
* Handbooks
* Annotated bibliographies
* Literature reviews
* Textbooks

## However...
The differences between these kinds of sources is in the perspective of the researcher.


### BEAM model for using sources
* Background: use a source to provide general information to explain the topic.
* Exhibit: use a source as evidence or examples to analyze.
* Argument: use a source to engage its argument.
* Method: use a sourceâ€™s way of analyzing an issue to apply to your own issue.
